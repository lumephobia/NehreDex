                <li>Be kind and respectful towards each other! We don't support drama, bagging, or harassment. Problems and disagreements should be taken to the staff. We are here to mediate and help within the community. Public blackmailing should not be the option to choose, please!</li>
                <li>Do not push themes that could make fellow members feel uncomfortable such as politics, religion, gore, or NSFW. We are strictly aiming for a "safe for work" atmosphere. Jokes, references or other mentions of these themes will not be tolerated! This goes for all kinds of communication, artwork, writing and other contribution to the community!</li>
                <li>Please refrain from contacting users to offer on characters that they do not have publicly listed as up for trade. Unwelcome trade offers can be uncomfortable or stressful for others, and we consider repeated offering or begging to be a form of harassment.</li>
                <li>Do not alter, edit or deface someone else's work or characters, without their permission.</li>
                <li>Do not upload, repost or otherwise add artwork and other content posted in the community to offsite platforms such as Pinterest without prior permission of the respective owners. This also goes for using content for prints and other merchandise.</li>

                <li>Taking inspiration from existing this is fine under most circumstances. To avoid problems with existing copyrights and trademarks we can not allow "cosplay" characters. This goes for official characters from books, games, comics or other brands of pop culture. But also for OCs and other adoptables.</li>
                <li>Designs need to get along with our general etiquette and shouldn't contain traits or elements which could make other people feel uncomfortable like politics, social-political symbols, religion, or any content of sexual nature.</li>
                <li>Artwork that is used for the masterlist, either as the main image or as references for additional forms must be fully rendered, coloured and show the full character. Make sure to keep in mind that this artwork serves the purpose of being a visual reference to recognize the character, when choosing a picture, please.</li>
                <li>You may commission another artist to draw your character's masterlist artwork. Make sure to ask for permission to use the artwork before submitting it, please!</li>

                <li>Voiding is a process by which a character is stripped of its eligibility for site and group participation. It's permanent and will be allowed under rare circumstances only. This process requires their design to be changed to be significant apart from the original character concept - this goes especially for Raunen!</li>
                <li>The voided design will remain on the masterlist for future reference and will be marked as voided.</li>
